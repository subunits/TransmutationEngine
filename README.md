# TransmutationEngine

Transform musical notation through quaternion space, cellular automata, and holographic encoding into ASCII visualization.

## Pipeline
```
Music → Quaternions → Cellular Automaton → Hologram → ASCII
```

## Quick Start
```bash
gcc -o transmutation TransmutationEngine.c -lm -O2
./transmutation
```

## What It Does

Takes musical input (frequency, duration, amplitude) and:
1. Converts notes to quaternion rotations in 3D space
2. Seeds a Wolfram cellular automaton with quaternion data
3. Evolves the CA and encodes evolution as holographic interference pattern
4. Renders the hologram as ASCII art

## Background

Synthesizes techniques from:
- Quaternion gesture systems (UQGVS)
- Cellular automata (FDCA-Simulator)  
- Holographic encoding (Body-Holographic)
- ASCII rendering (ascii-camera-preview)

Explores **transmutation**: fundamental transformation between representational domains.
